What it would have looked like if ITG3 was officially released and was modded by the community.
Inspired by the ITG2 H4X Theme and also based on the [itg3theme](https://github.com/openitg/itg3theme).

1. Clone or Download!
2. Extract the .zip or contents of itg3-h4x-edition into the root of your OpenITG or NotITG installation!
3. Then change the theme through OpenITG or NotITG!
4. Done!

What is the Nostalgia noteskin:
The Nostalgia noteskin is the base of the default/note noteskin from SM3.9
But with default ITG note colors and note explosion colors.
